      descriptionTitle: "Woldia University is a public university in Woldia, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.",
      description: `Woldia University is one of the public universities established by the Government of Ethiopia following its plan to expand higher education institutions in the country’ to increase access and shore up its economic development and social transformation. Education coverage of Ethiopia so minimal even compared to the Sub-Saharan Africa. The Government of Ethiopia exerted its effort in expansion of education in the country to increase its educated human capital that meets the labor market demand of the nation. With this intention, the University was established in 2011 in Woldia town, North Wollo Zone, Amhara National Regional State on a 201-hectare. Currently the university has three campuses: Woldia Campus (main), Mersa Agricultural College, and St. Lalibela Institute of Heritage and Tourism Studies. Woldia is located in a cross-sectional geographic location which interconnects Samara (Afar), Mekele (Tigray) and Bahir Dar (Amhara), Dessie (Amhara) and in a distance of 520 KMs north of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

  When the University began its teaching-learning process in 2011, it enrolled 573 regular undergraduate students in four faculties of twelve departments, and 156 week end (extension) undergraduate students in two departments, having 115 academic and 117 administrative staffs. Currently, the university has two institutes, two colleges, four faculties and six schools. Extensive work is being done in the community service sectors. The university has 1,285 teachers and technical assistants, 958 permanent administrative staffs, and 983 members of service providing Associations to whom campus cleaning, security, catering and cafeteria, and many other services are outsourced.

The Federal democratic republic of Ethiopia, ministry of Education tried to differentiate higher education institutions to play a great role on the national development agenda. Higher education institution in Ethiopia has been differentiated based on their generations, facilities, geographic location and the natural resource they have in their mandate area. The differentiation reform planned for the higher education sector has been focused on thematic areas including access, equity, and unity with diversity, quality, relevance, efficiency, research, technology transfer and community services, and the financing of higher education.

Since its establishment by the Government of Ethiopia, in 2011 G.C. the university had passed through a noticeable development progress for the past ten (12) years. Laboratories, workshops, libraries, offices, student services, ICT infrastructures, staff residence, guesthouses, electrical and water supply infrastructures, teacher’s residence, etc. were all up to par.

The university has competitive advantages in the area of tourism, agriculture, technology and health.  So in our 5 years strategic plan we identified tourism, agriculture, technology and health as a major area of excellence. Thus the departure mainly started from the listed center of Excellences of the university. 

If you would like to study in the university in the heart of the city that focus on changing the world for better to morrow, you’re choosing the right place. We do not use special formulas to select students. We look at every single applicant’s application, academic and personal, to select students who suit to our community with a full range of backgrounds. If you would like to study`
